# Training
First, activate your Python VENV where you have all dependencies installed:

```sh
$ source ~/YOUR_VENV/bin/activate
```

Multi-GPU and multi-node training is supported with [Hugging Face Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index). You can configure Accelerate by running:

```sh
$ accelerate config
```

on all nodes, then running:

```sh
$ accelerate launch train.py --config CONFIG_FILE --name RUN_NAME --wandb-entity frangam --wandb-project diffusion-ts-rp --current-fold 0 --class-label 0 --max-epochs 2000 > results/fold_0.log
```

on all nodes.

Also, you can run the script with [nohup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup) which ignores the hangup signal. This means that you can close the terminal without stopping the execution. Also, don’t forget to add & so the script runs in the background:

```sh
$ nohup accelerate launch train.py --config CONFIG_FILE --name RUN_NAME --wandb-entity frangam --wandb-project diffusion-ts-rp --current-fold 0 --class-label 0 --max-epochs 2000 > results/fold_0.log &
```

In addition, to close remote terminal safely, you have to run the exit commant, and do not close manually the terminal:

```sh
$ exit
```

Finally, you can identify the running processes of training script with:
```sh
$ ps ax | grep test.py
```

or list of all running processes of Python:
```sh
$ ps -fA | grep python
```

then, kill the desired one:

```sh
$ kill PID
```

## Clone a repository

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repository](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).
